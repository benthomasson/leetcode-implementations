# Plan (Iteration 1)

Task: Solve the LeetCode problem "guess-number-higher-or-lower":

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

*   `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
*   `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
*   `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
*   `1 <= pick <= n`

**Requirements:**
- Implement the solution with proper type hints
- Add comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Create thorough unit tests covering edge cases
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Function name should be: guessNumber

IMPORTANT - EFFORT LEVEL: MINIMAL
Keep plan VERY brief (2-3 paragraphs max). Focus only on algorithm choice. Skip architectural discussions and detailed analysis.

Plan written to `PLAN.md`. Binary search — straightforward and optimal for this problem.
