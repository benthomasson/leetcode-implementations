# Plan (Iteration 1)

Task: Solve the LeetCode problem "number-of-recent-calls":

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:

*   `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
*   `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past `3000` milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.

It is **guaranteed** that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "RecentCounter ",  "ping ",  "ping ",  "ping ",  "ping "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[100\], \[3001\], \[3002\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 3, 3\]

**Explanation**
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = \[1\], range is \[-2999,1\], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = \[1, 100\], range is \[-2900,100\], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = \[1, 100, 3001\], range is \[1,3001\], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = \[1, 100, 3001, 3002\], range is \[2,3002\], return 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= t <= 109`
*   Each test case will call `ping` with **strictly increasing** values of `t`.
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `ping`.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the solution with proper type hints
- Add comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Create thorough unit tests covering edge cases
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Function name should be: increasingBST

IMPORTANT - EFFORT LEVEL: MINIMAL
Keep plan VERY brief (2-3 paragraphs max). Focus only on algorithm choice. Skip architectural discussions and detailed analysis.

Plan written to `planner/PLAN.md`. Summary:

- **Algorithm:** Queue (`collections.deque`) — append new timestamp, evict entries older than `t - 3000`, return length.
- **Complexity:** O(1) amortized time, O(W) space where W is bounded by the 3000ms window.
- **Note:** The "increasingBST" function name requirement is a copy-paste error; using correct `RecentCounter`/`ping` names.
- **Confidence:** HIGH.
