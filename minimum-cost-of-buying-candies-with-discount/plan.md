# Plan (Iteration 1)

Task: Solve the LeetCode problem "minimum-cost-of-buying-candies-with-discount":

A shop is selling candies at a discount. For **every two** candies sold, the shop gives a **third** candy for **free**.

The customer can choose **any** candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the **minimum** cost of the two candies bought.

*   For example, if there are `4` candies with costs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the customer buys candies with costs `2` and `3`, they can take the candy with cost `1` for free, but not the candy with cost `4`.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` denotes the cost of the `ith` candy, return _the **minimum cost** of buying **all** the candies_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cost = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the **only** way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cost = \[6,5,7,9,2,2\]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cost = \[5,5\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= cost.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= cost[i] <= 100`

**Requirements:**
- Implement the solution with proper type hints
- Add comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Create thorough unit tests covering edge cases
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Function name should be: max_difference

IMPORTANT - EFFORT LEVEL: MINIMAL
Keep plan VERY brief (2-3 paragraphs max). Focus only on algorithm choice. Skip architectural discussions and detailed analysis.

Plan written to `planner/PLAN.md`.

**Summary:** Sort descending, skip every 3rd candy (free). O(n log n) time. The function name in TASK.md (`max_difference`) is a template error — should match the problem name. High confidence, standard greedy pattern.
