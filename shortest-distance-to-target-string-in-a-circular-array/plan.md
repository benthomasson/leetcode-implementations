# Plan (Iteration 1)

Task: Solve the LeetCode problem "shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array":

You are given a **0-indexed** **circular** string array `words` and a string `target`. A **circular array** means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.

*   Formally, the next element of `words[i]` is `words[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `words[i]` is `words[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, where `n` is the length of `words`.

Starting from `startIndex`, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with `1` step at a time.

Return _the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string_ `target`. If the string `target` does not exist in `words`, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "hello ", "i ", "am ", "leetcode ", "hello "\], target =  "hello ", startIndex = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We start from index 1 and can reach  "hello " by
- moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
- moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
- moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
The shortest distance to reach  "hello " is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "a ", "b ", "leetcode "\], target =  "leetcode ", startIndex = 0
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We start from index 0 and can reach  "leetcode " by
- moving 2 units to the right to reach index 3.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 3.
The shortest distance to reach  "leetcode " is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "i ", "eat ", "leetcode "\], target =  "ate ", startIndex = 0
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Since  "ate " does not exist in `words`, we return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
*   `words[i]` and `target` consist of only lowercase English letters.
*   `0 <= startIndex < words.length`

**Requirements:**
- Implement the solution with proper type hints
- Add comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Create thorough unit tests covering edge cases
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Function name should be: shortest_distance

IMPORTANT - EFFORT LEVEL: MINIMAL
Keep plan VERY brief (2-3 paragraphs max). Focus only on algorithm choice. Skip architectural discussions and detailed analysis.

Plan written to `PLAN.md`. The approach is a simple O(n) linear scan with the standard circular distance formula — no complexity needed here.
