# Plan (Iteration 1)

Task: Solve the LeetCode problem "palindrome-number":

Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

**Requirements:**
- Implement the solution with proper type hints
- Add comprehensive Google-style docstring
- Create thorough unit tests covering edge cases
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Function name should be: is_palindrome

IMPORTANT - EFFORT LEVEL: MINIMAL
Keep plan VERY brief (2-3 paragraphs max). Focus only on algorithm choice. Skip architectural discussions and detailed analysis.

Plan written to `PLAN.md`. The half-reversal approach is optimal — O(log n) time, O(1) space, no string conversion.
